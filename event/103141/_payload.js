That commitment spurred Andy and his wife Susie Code, a graduate of the UI College of Nursing, to establish the Code Family Foundation in 1997. The foundation has helped young boys and girls get quality educations in their home countries and has sponsored many students who wish to study in the United States. Code and his philanthropic partners have built schools, dormitories, and kitchens in under-resourced areas where educational opportunities had previously been nearly nonexistent.\n\nCode’s personal involvement as a mentor to young Haitians who are enrolled in courses on entrepreneurship in the Tippie College’s Institute for International Business inspires students and advances the University of Iowa’s educational mission. But Code’s social justice commitments in Haiti and elsewhere go beyond education and entrepreneurship. He supports numerous organizations that are involved in health justice in marginalized communities around the world. The Code family’s ongoing support has allowed local healthcare entities to strengthen capacity and deepen partner relationships so that they are better equipped to confront challenges when they arise. Major contributions to the UI College of Medicine and College of Nursing support impactful healthcare programs in Niger and Eswatini, and Code’s funding supports pediatric care and healthier futures for children in several remote Ugandan communities.\n\nCode holds a BA in finance and an MBA from the University of Iowa and is a founder, partner, and chairman of Promus, a private equity investment firm. He has served as a board member and advisor to numerous public and private companies, serves on the national board of directors for Young Life, and is incoming board chair for the University of Iowa Center for Advancement. Code’s abiding and passionate commitment to putting his wealth and good fortune to work for the benefit of others led him to found the organization Chicago Fellowship, where he serves as chair.  \n\nGlobal Student Awards\n\nThe Global Student Awards recognize one undergraduate and one graduate student who are leaders deeply engaged in international education on campus or abroad. The award was established by UI International Programs and the Division of Student Life in 2019.   \n\nThe winners of the 2022 Global Student Awards are Ryann Hubbart, an undergraduate student (international studies and economics) from Clinton, Iowa, and Frankline Matanji, a PhD student (journalism and mass communications) from Mumias, Kenya.\n\nWorldCanvass is a production of International Programs in partnership with the UI Stanley Museum of Art. Programs are recorded as audio podcasts and are available on iTunes, the Public Radio Exchange (PRX), and the WorldCanvass website.  Videos are available on YouTube.  Audio production is provided by Kyle Marxen.  \n",description:"\u003Cp\u003EAndy Code, 2022 recipient of the UI’s International Impact Award, and Global Student awardees will be honored on the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Finternational.uiowa.edu\u002Fglobal-network\u002Fworldcanvass\u002Fworldcanvass-2022-international-impact-and-global-student-awards\"\u003ENov. 7 WorldCanvass\u003C\u002Fa\u003E which officially opens the UI’s celebration of International Education Week (Nov. 14-18).
