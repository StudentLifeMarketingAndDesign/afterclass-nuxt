The event is free and open to the public.\n\nImmigration and ethnonational diversity in the context of Europe is a salient political issue shaped by emerging manifestations of prejudice towards different categories of migrant populations. The premise of this talk is that European public discourses often mirror the anti-immigrant and anti-refugee discourses embraced by political parties and elites in instances of institutional and political turmoil. During his presentation, Dr. Escandell will examine these public and political elite discourses in several contexts: throughout the UK’s process of breaking up with the EU (BREXIT) and during the 2015 Syrian and European refugee crisis (and tangentially, the ongoing war and displacement of refugees from Ukraine). Additionally, Dr. Escandell will discuss the social movements and strategic opportunities that politicians and other stakeholders consider when they put radical institutional reforms on the table.\n\nDr. Xavier Escandell is an associate professor of sociology and director of the Data Analysis and Social Inquiry Lab at Grinnell College. His research explores immigration, transnationalism, and race\u002Fethnic relations in the context of Western and Eastern Europe and Latin America. His published work appears in journals such as Annual Review of Sociology, British Journal of Sociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Social Science Research, International Migration, International Migration Review, and Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies among others.\n\nFor more information on the European Studies Group and upcoming events, visit the ESG webpage.\n",description:"\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Finternational.uiowa.edu\u002Feuropean-studies-group\"\u003EEuropean Studies Group\u003C\u002Fa\u003E will present a guest lecture by Dr. Xavier Escandell entitled \"Ethnonational Diversity and Variation in Immigrant Deservingness Amidst Institutional Turmoil in Europe\" on\u003Cstrong\u003E Friday, Nov. 11, from noon to 1:30 p.m., in 1117 University Capitol Centre\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.
